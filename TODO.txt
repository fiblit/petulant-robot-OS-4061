Use this file as a way to keep track of what we need to do. Note that
github supports the feature of issues to do this, but I sometimes find
this more convenient. It can be worth it to change both this file and 
add an issue on the matter, be it bug, task, or feature.

Bugs: (This is essentially for remembering any bugs you had when you
	last left, or if you're stuck and need help.)
# : name(if any) : status ("I got it" or "I NEED HEEEELP")
	description of fault
	:
	potential sources
	:
	potential solutions
Or you can just type them in any format. I honestly don't care, but any
added order can be nice.

Tasks:
# : name : status : assigned to
	description
Or you can just type them in any format. I honestly don't care, but any
added order can be nice.

4 : Add BFS/Loop detect : low priority : Dalton
	There will be a slightly modified form of BFS to ensure that there 
	are no cycles in the input graph. This is nessecary for the
	construction of the row list.

5 : Main Functionality : high priority : Tim...?
	Some things main will include:
	-Reading file into nodes buffer/array
	-Process fan over the current row of the row list.
	-Exec each node in that row.
	-The control process (main) will wait all of the nodes in the row (needs the r_wait function)
6 : Integrate New Types/Structures : high priority : both
	In commit 95f832eb7ea326b5946bb365d0c34b1000e1e79e I changed many
	of the types used by graph.c and IO.c
	graphexec.c needs to be updated accordingly

Again, github supports a lot of these things. Normally I just handle my
TODO locally, but since we are working together it might be beneficial
to use it together, or to use github. If we do end up sharing this file
back and forth, be aware that there will be A LOT of merge clashing.
