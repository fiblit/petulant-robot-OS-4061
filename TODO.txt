Use this file as a way to keep track of what we need to do. Note that
github supports the feature of issues to do this, but I sometimes find
this more convenient. It can be worth it to change both this file and 
add an issue on the matter, be it bug, task, or feature.

Bugs: (This is essentially for remembering any bugs you had when you
	last left, or if you're stuck and need help.)
# : name(if any) : status ("I got it" or "I NEED HEEEELP")
	description of fault
	:
	potential sources
	:
	potential solutions
Or you can just type them in any format. I honestly don't care, but any
added order can be nice.

Tasks:
# : name : status : assigned to
	description
Or you can just type them in any format. I honestly don't care, but any
added order can be nice.

Again, github supports a lot of these things. Normally I just handle my
TODO locally, but since we are working together it might be beneficial
to use it together, or to use github. If we do end up sharing this file
back and forth, be aware that there will be A LOT of merge clashing.
