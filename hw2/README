Purpose of your Program
---------------------------------------
The purpose of our program is to encode / decode all files present in the given input directory
and outputting the encoding/decoding to the output directory.

How to Compile Program
---------------------------------------
To compile the program simply type make into the command line,
$ make

How to Use the Program from the Shell
---------------------------------------
To use the program from the shell you must first compile it using make, then type
./codec_4061 -(e|d) <directory input comes from> <output directory>
(e|d) means either -e or -d (for encoding or decoding)
for example, to encode from directory encodetest02 into directory output you would type
$ ./codec_4061 -e encodetest02 output
and to decode from directory decodetest02 into directory output you would type
$ ./codec_4061 -d decodetest02 output

What Exactly the Program Does
---------------------------------------
At a high level this program will recursively read all of the files in a directory, and its
subdirectories, decode or encode them, and then output them to an output directory in the
same format as they were in the input directory. A report file is also generated in the output
file describing the files encoded or decoded, and their sizes before and after. Soft links are
ignored in this program, but there presence is noted in the report file. Duplicate hard links are
also ignored in this program, but are also noted in the report file.

Some of the specific uses of various files in our program are the following:
codec_4061.c/h : main and a couple of helper functions
codec.c/h : encode or decode a small block of bytes
encode_decode.c/h : encode or decode a file
inodeLL.c/h : a linked list for tracking the hard links' inodes
