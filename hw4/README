EC was completed.

"Bug" note:
	Don't run more than about 1000-5000 clients
	At that point the memory leaks catch up to the server and malloc gets a failed assertion...
		so we think, at least.
	For legitimate testing we usually did <100 clients
	Stress testing in the range of 1k 5k or 10k usually ended up crashing the server depending on
    the client file sizes. It also takes a long time to run.

	Approximate formula for "client" limit: (This is really rough)
		cities_in_client * concurrent_client_daemons < ~4000

	Final Note:
		You know what. Just don't run more than 100 clients concurrently. The server's queue loves
		to crash from memory overflow/corruption/bad free.

	Best Stress Tests:
		50 concurrent clients with 78(?) cities each
        1000 concurrent clients with 1 city each

options:
 if there is a "-v" at the end of the command for twitterTrend_client or twitterTrend_server, they will print the optional debug stuff
 e.g.

 $ ./twitterTrend_server 7575 5 -v
 server listens on port 7575
 ^C 
 $ echo ... and so on
 ... and so on
