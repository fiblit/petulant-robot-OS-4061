EC was completed.

"Bug" note:
	The server crashes due to memory leaks if it is over-stressed.
		The client will exit robustly
        A lot of the memory leaks were... ugly... we'd get some interesting errors where malloc would
        fail an assertion when we tried to fix it. Thankfully, the server crashed usually outside of the bounds of the assumptions

	Best Stress Tests:
		100 concurrent clients with 78 cities each
        1000(0?) concurrent clients with 1 city each (I tried 10k again, but it acted kinda weird, I think it only did 5k on that one)
		~5000 consecutive clients with 1 city each (I was trying to do 10k and malloc crasheds

options:
 the -v option at the end of the command line arguments
 e.g. "./twitterTrend_server 7575 5 -v" will silence any of the 'optional' debug  output from section
 2.3.6 of the requirements
 e.g.eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
   server listens
   client conencts
   ...
