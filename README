Purpose of Program
--------------------------------------
The purpose of the graphexec program is to analyze a graph of user programs and
determine which of these are eligible to run at the time, then running them in the
proper order.

How to Compile Program
--------------------------------------
To compile our program, all you have to do is type make at the command line.
This will compile everything that needs to be compiled to create an executable.

example: % make

How to Use the Program
--------------------------------------
Once the program is compiled, you can run it by typing
./graphexec some-graph-file.txt
where some-graph-file.txt is the graphfile you want graphexec to analyze and run.

example: % ./graphexec testgraph1.txt

What Exactly graphexec Does
--------------------------------------
graphexec first reads nodes from the given text file (one per line), then builds
a "rowlist" which determines which nodes are allowed to run. It then runs those
nodes row by row, where each row has the next nodes allowed to run. It does this
until there are no more nodes available to run, and the program is finished.

(A note on the "rowlist" data structure: It was meant to stand for "rows of lists"
but is actually just a 2d array of pointers to nodes. Each row contains siblings
in the graph.)
