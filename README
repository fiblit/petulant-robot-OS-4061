Purpose of Program
--------------------------------------
The purpose of the graphexec program is to analyze a graph of user programs and
determine which of these are eligible to run at the time, then running them in the
proper order.

How to Compile Program
--------------------------------------
To compile our program, all you have to do is type make at the command line.
This will compile everything that needs to be compiled to create an executable.

example: % make

How to Use the Program
--------------------------------------
Once the program is compiled, you can run it by typing
./graphexec some-graph-file.txt
where some-graph-file.txt is the graphfile you want graphexec to analyze and run.

example: % ./graphexec testgraph1.txt

What Exactly graphexec Does
--------------------------------------
graphexec first reads nodes from the given text file (one per line), then builds
a rowlist which determines which nodes are allowed to run. It then runs those
nodes and moves on to the next row, which has the next nodes which are allowed
to run. It does this until there are no more nodes available to run, and the
program is finished.
